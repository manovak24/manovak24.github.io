                    <p>Thank you for visiting my website! I am a web developer based in Marquette, Michigan. Originally from the suburbs of Chicago, I made the move to the Upper Peninsula in 2008 to attend Northern Michigan University where I studied Finance & Risk Management. In addition, I played on the ACHA DII hockey team for five years, being an ACHA Academic All American Hockey Player for my final two seasons. After completing my undergraduate degree I was admitted as a Graduate Assistant to the Masters of Business Administration program at NMU.</p>
                    <p>Following my academic and hockey career, I began my professional development. First starting out in the finance industry and eventually switching to the medical device industry, where I have spent the last three years. I have enjoyed the professional experiences along the way, but always left with feeling that I was meant to do something elseâ€¦. This is where the real story begins.</p>
                    <p>Exploring possible career paths, I came across web development. At first it started as a side hobby. Coding on the weekends and slowly making steps forward. Eventually the snowball effect took control and soon became a sole focus in my life. I have been enrolled in the CodeCademy Full-Stack Web Development course for the past year. This is been a challenging, humbling and rewarding experience. I love to continuously learn and keep progressing forward.</p>
